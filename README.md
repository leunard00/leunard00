I have worked with ASP.NET Core to develop an entrepreneurial eCommerce application, these projects had me collaborating in groups spanning 
from 3-4 individuals.

My academic journey has earned me a great deal of experience working with a variety of programming tools such as: 
- Visual Studio 2019
- GitHub Desktop
- Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
