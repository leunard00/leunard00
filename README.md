#👋 Hello, I'm Leunard Gervalla! 👋#   
❗ I am a recent graduate of Conestoga College with an advanced diploma in Computer Programming and Analysis ❗

I have worked with ASP.NET Core to develop an entrepreneurial eCommerce application while developing complex database 
systems with the use of Microsoft SQL Server along with SQL scripts, these projects had me collaborating in groups spanning 
from 3-4 individuals.
